Introduction 
	Unix is simple and coherent,but it takes a genius
	(or at any rate a programmer) to understand
	and appreciate the simplicity.
	--Dennis Ritchie
	
	Note grom the authors:Tes,we have lost our minds.
	Be forewarned:you will lose yours too,
	-- Benny Goodheart  James Cox
	
	Unix is distinguished by a simple,coherent,and lelgant design - truly remarkable features that have 
	enabled the system to influence the world for more than a quarter of a century.And especially thanks
	to the growing presence of Linux,the idea is still picking up momentum,which no end of the growth 
	in sight.
	Unix and Linux carry a certain fascination,and two quotations above hopefully capture the spirit of 
	this attraction.Consider Dennis Ritchie`s quote:Is the coinventor of Unix at Bell Labs completely right
	in saying that only a genius can appreciate the simplicity of Unix? Luckily not,because he puts himself
	into perspective immediately by adding that programmers also qualify to value the essence of Unix.
	Understanding the meagerly documented,demanding,and complex sources of Unix as of Linux 
	is not alwalys an easy task.But once has atarted to experience the rich insights that can be gained from
	the kernal sources,it is hard to escape the fascibation of Linux.It seems fair to warn you that it`s easy 
	to get addicted to the joy of the operating system kernel once starting to dive into it.This was already 
	noted by Benny Goodheart and James Cox,whose preface to their book the magic Garden Explained 
	(SECOND QUOTATION ABOVE)explained the internals of Unix System V.And Linux is definitely also capable 
	of helping you to lose your mind!
	This book acts as a guide and companion that takes you through the kernel sources and sharpens your
	awareness of the beauty,elegance,and --last but not least --esthetics of their concepts.There are,however,
	some prerequisites to foster an understanding of the kernel.C should not just be a letter;neither
	should it be a foreign language.Operating systems are supposed to be more than just a "Start"button,and 
	a small amount of algorithmics can also do no harm.finally,it is preferable if computer architecture is not
	just about how how to build the most fansy case.From an academic piont of view,this comes closest to the 
	lectures "Systems Programming,""Algorithmics"and "Fundamentals of Operating Systems"The previous
	edition of this book has been used to tesvh the fundamentals of Linux to advenced undergraduate
	stufents in several universities,and I hope that the current edition will serve the same purpose.
	Discussing all aforementioned in topics in details right now(or maybe you are not holding it,for this 
	very reason),you`ll surely agree that this would not be a good ides.When a topic not directly related to
